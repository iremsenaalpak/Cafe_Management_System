## Project Overview

**Caffe HUB** is a Smart Cafe Management System designed to enhance customer experience using advanced AI solutions while meeting the operational needs of a modern cafe. The system allows business owners to manage menu contents, product tags, and customer feedback via a centralized panel. Its key feature is the integrated **Caffe HUB Assistant**, which offers personalized product recommendations based on customers' specific preferences (e.g., vegan, diet, sugar-free) or sensitivities (e.g., allergen content filtering).
